1 Abstract
══════════

  Crash dumps, also known as core dumps, have been a part of BSD since
  it’s beginnings in Research UNIX. A core dump is ``a copy of memory
  that is saved on secondary storage by the kernel’’ for debugging a
  system failure[1]. Though 38 years have passed since `doadump()' came
  about in UNIX/32V, core dumps are still needed and utilized in much
  the same way they were then. Given this, one might assume the core
  dump code changed little over time but, with some research, this
  assumption has proven incorrect.

  What has changed over time is where core dumps are sent to and what
  processor architectures are supported. Previous to the advent of UNIX,
  core dumps were printed to a line printer or punch cards. At the birth
  of UNIX core dumps were made to magnetic tape and because UNIX only
  supported the PDP-11, it was the only architecture supported for
  dumps. Over time machine architecture support has evolved from
  different PDP-11 models to hp300, i386 up to the present day with
  AMD64 and ARM64. In addition the type of dump device has changed from
  tape, to hard disk or another machine over a LAN.

  The following paper begins with a quick background on what core dumps
  are and why operators might need them. Following that the current
  state of the core dump facility and some of the more common extensions
  in use are examined. We conclude with a call to action for upstreaming
  these extensions and modularizing the core dump code such that
  different methods of core dump can be dynamically loaded into the
  kernel on demand.

  In addition a complete history of core dumps in UNIX and BSD was
  produced as research for this paper and can be found in the appendix.


2 Introduction
══════════════

  The BSD core dump facility performs a simple yet vital service to the
  operator: preserving a copy of the contents of system memory at the
  time of a fatal error for later debugging.

  This copy or ``dump’’ can be a machine readable form of the complete
  contents of system memory, or just the set of kernel pages that are
  active at the time of the crash. There is also support for dumping a
  less complete but human readable debugger scripting output.

  Throughout the history of UNIX operating systems, different methods
  have been used to produce a core dump. In the earliest UNIXes magnetic
  tape was the only supported dump device but when hard disk support
  matured swap space was used, obviating the need for changing out tapes
  before a dump[2]. Modern and embedded systems continue to introduce
  new constraints that have motivated the need for newer methods of
  ex-filtrating a core dump from a faltering kernel.

  The FreeBSD variant of the BSD operating system has introduced gradual
  extensions to the core dumping facility. FreeBSD 6.2 introduced
  ``minidumps’’, a subset of a full dump that only consists of active
  kernel memory. FreeBSD 7.1’s `textdumps(4)' consist of the result of
  debugger commands input interactivly in DDB or via script[3]. FreeBSD
  12-CURRENT introduced support for public-key cryptographic encryption
  of core dumps.

  Though not in the main source tree, compressed dumps and the ability
  to dump to a remote network device exist and function. While
  promising, these extensions have been inconsistent in their
  integration and interoperability.

  Another BSD derived OS, Mac OS X has also introduced similar
  compression and network dumping features into their kernel albeit with
  a distinct pedigree from FreeBSD[4][5].

  The following paper will provide a historical survey of the dump
  facility itself, from its’ introduction in UNIX to its’ current form
  in modern BSDs and BSD derived operating systems. We will also explore
  these core dump extensions, associated tools, and describe an active
  effort to fully modularize them, allowing the operator to enable one
  or more of them simultaneously.


3 Motivation
════════════

  In UNIX and early BSD’s core dumps were originally made to magnetic
  tape which was superseded by dumping to a swap partition on a hard
  disk since at least 3BSD. For decades since, increases in physical
  system memory and swap partition size have loosely tracked increases
  in available persistent memory, allowing for the continued use of this
  paradigm.

  However, recent advances in commodity system hardware have upended the
  traditional memory to disk space ratio with systems now routinely
  utilizing 1TB or more physical memory whilst running on less than
  256GB of solid state disk. Given that the kernel memory footprint has
  grown in size, the assumption that disk space would always allow for a
  swap partition large enough for a core dump has proved to be
  inaccurate. This change has spurred development of several extensions
  to the core dumping facility, including compressed dumping to swap and
  dumping over the network to a server with disk space for modern core
  dumps. Because dumps contain all the contents of memory any sensitive
  information in flight at the time of a crash appears in the dump. For
  this reason encrypted dumps have been recently added to FreeBSD[6].

  While dealing with the above problems the author and his colleagues
  became intimately familiar with the state of the core dump code and
  its’ associated documentation. As users of the core dump code they
  felt a need for more flexibility and extensibity in the core dump
  routines of FreeBSD. The author intends to provide a basis for the
  argument that the core dump code should be modularized for the
  flexibility that provides to operators.

  In addition it is hoped that the information herein is of use to
  inform further work on core dumps, failing that we hope it is
  interesting.


4 The Present
═════════════

4.1 Core Dumps in FreeBSD
─────────────────────────

4.1.1 Full Core Dump Procedure
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  When a UNIX-like system such as FreeBSD encounters an unrecoverable
  and unexpected error the kernel will “panic”. Though the word panic
  has connotations of irrationality, the function `panic(9)' maintains
  composure while it shutsdown the running system and attempts to save a
  core dump to a configured dump device.

  What follows is a thorough description of the FreeBSD core dump
  routine (as of FreeBSD 11-RELEASE) starting with `doadump()' in
  `sys/kern/kern_shutdown.c'.

  `doadump()' is called by `kern_reboot()', which shuts down “the system
  cleanly to prepare for reboot, halt, or power off.” [7]
  `kern_reboot()' calls `doadump()' if the `RB_DUMP' flag is set and the
  system is not “cold” or already creating a core dump. `doadump()'
  takes a boolean informing it to whether or not to take a “text dump”,
  a form of dump carried out if the online kernel debugger, `DDB', is
  built into the running kernel. `doaddump()' returns an error code if
  the system is currently creating a dump, the dumper is NULL and
  returns error codes on behalf of `dumpsys()'.

  `doadump(boolean_t textdump)' starts the core dump procedure by saving
  the current context with a call to `savectx()'. At this point if they
  are configured, a “text dump” can be carried out. Otherwise a core
  dump is invoked using `dumpsys()', passing it a `struct dumper'.
  `dumpsys()' is defined on a per-architecture basis. This allows
  different architectures to setup their dump structure differently.
  `dumpsys()' calls `dumpsys_generic()' passing along the `struct
  dumperinfo' it was called with. `dumpsys_generic()' is defined in
  `sys/kern/kern_dump.c' and is the meat of the core dump procedure.

  There are several main steps to the `dumpsys_generic()' procedure. The
  main steps are as follows. At any point if there is an error
  condition, goto failure cleanup at the end of the procedure.

  1. Fill in the ELF header.
  2. Calculate the dump size.
  3. Determine if the dump device is large enough.
  4. Fill in kernel dump header
  5. Begin Dump
     1. Leader
     2. ELF Header
     3. Program Headers
     4. Memory Chunks
     5. Trailer
  6. End Dump

  After this is done the kernel writes out a NULL byte to “Signal
  completion, signoff and exit stage left.” And our core dump is
  complete.


4.1.2 Full Core Dump Contents
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  The canonical form of core dump is the “full dump”. Full dumps are
  created via the `doadump()' code path which starts in
  `sys/kern/kern_shutdown.c'. The resulting dump is an ELF formatted
  binary written to a configured swap partition. The following is based
  on amd64 code and is the result of `dumpsys_generic()'. This will be
  similar in format but different values for different architectures.

4.1.3 Minidump Procedure and Contents
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  FreeBSD 6.2 introduced a new form of core dump termed, “minidumps”.
  Instead of dumping all of phsyical memory to guarantee all relevent
  information is archived, minidumps dump ``only memory pages in use by
  the kernel.’’[8]

  Minidumps use a custom format in lieu of ELF. The format of a modern
  minidump (version 2) can be found in table 4.

  Table 5: `minidumphdr' Format

  The minidump procedure in general is similiar to that of the full dump
  but with the added step of creating a bitmap that indicates which
  pages are to become part of the dump. The minidump procedure detailed
  here is based on the AMD64 code as found in
  `sys/amd64/amd64/minidump_machdep.c'[9], but it nearly identical for
  other architectures.

  1. Create bitmap describing pages to be dumped.
  2. Calculate the dump size.
  3. Determine if the dump device is large enough.
  4. Fill in minidump header
  5. Fill in kernel dump header
  6. Begin Dump
     1. Leader

     3. Message Buffer
     4. Bitmap
     5. Kernel Page Directory
     6. Memory Chunks
     7. Trailer
  7. End Dump

     The minidump will fail for any of the reasons a full dump will and
     also if the dump map grows while creating it. This will cause the
     routine to retry up to `dump_retry_count' times, the default is 5
     times but can be set with the sysctl `machdep.dump_retry_count'.

4.2 Core Dumps in Mac OS X
──────────────────────────

  Mac OS X is capable of creating gzipped core dumps and dumping
  locally, or over the network using a modified `tftpd(8)' daemon they
  call `kdumpd(8)'. In addition dumps over FireWire are supported for
  situations where the kernel panic is caused by the Ethernet driver or
  network code.


  In `xnu/osfmk/kdp/kdp_core.c' Mac OS X gzips its’ core dump before
  writing it out to disk, and is otherwise much like the FreeBSD “full
  dump” procedure with one major difference. Notably, Mac OS X uses a
  different executable image-format called Mach-O, as opposed to ELF,
  because OS X runs a hybrid Mach and BSD kernel called XNU.

  Network dumping “has been present since Mac OS X 10.3 for
  PowerPC-based Macintosh systems, and since Mac OS X 10.4.7 for
  Intel-based Macintosh systems.”[4] From `kdumpd(8)'[10]:
        Kdumpd is a server which receives kernel states in the
        form of a core dump from a remote Mac OS X machine.

        …

        The kdumpd command is based on Berkeley tftpd(8) by way of
        FreeBSD, with several modifications.


5 The Future
════════════

  There are several extensions to the FreeBSD core dump code that exist
  as sets of patches on mailing lists and wikis but are not found in
  upstream FreeBSD.

  First we provide some background on several extensions and tools
  including dumping over the network, compressed dumps and a tool for
  estimating the size of a minidump. Then we will explore the benifets
  of modularized core dump code.


5.1 `netdump' - Network Dump
────────────────────────────

  Crash dumping over the network can be especially useful in embedded
  systems that do not have adequately sized swap partitions.

  The original netdump code was written by Darrell Anderson at Duke
  around 2000 in the FreeBSD 4.x era as a kernel module. This code was
  later ported to modern FreeBSD in 2010 at Sandvine with the intention
  of being part of FreeBSD 9.0, which did not succeed.

  Currently there exists working netdump code at Isilon that applies
  cleanly to versions of FreeBSD after 11 but before encrypted dump was
  added in FreeBSD 12-CURRENT. Network dumps have not yet made it into
  upstream FreeBSD.


5.2 Compressed Dump
───────────────────

  Modern systems often have several hundred gigabytes of RAM and will
  soon often have terabytes. This means full crash dumps, even
  minidumps, can be much larger than most sensible amounts of swap.

  Though `savecore(8)' has the ability to compress core dumps with the
  ``-z'' option, this only compresses a core once it is copied into the
  main filesystem. The core dump that was written to the swap partition
  remains uncompressed.

  Compressed dumps see a 6 to 14 compression ratio for core dumps with a
  slight penalty in the time require to write the dump initially[11].
  However the following `savecore(8)' on the next boot is faster,
  resulting in a faster dump and reboot sequence.

  Compressed dumps have not yet made it into upstream FreeBSD.


5.3 `minidumpsz' - Minidump Size Estimation
───────────────────────────────────────────

  `minidumpsz' is a kernel module that can do an online estimation of
  the size of a minidump if it were to occur at the time `sysctl
  debug.mini_dump_size' is called.

  `minidumpsz' performs an inactive version of the minidump routine,
  `minidumpsys()', to estimate the size of a dump if it were to take
  place at the time of the sysctl’s calling.

  `minidumpsz' was created by Rodney W. Grimes for the author’s work at
  Groupon and applies to FreeBSD 10.1 and FreeBSD 11. `minidumpsz' has
  not yet made it into upstream FreeBSD.


5.4 Modularizing Dump Code (incomplete)
───────────────────────────────────────

  • Backporting features and fixes added to dump code becomes trivial
  • Development becomes easier because LKMs are easier to work with
  • Embedded systems benifet from a smaller kernel


5.5 Live Dump (incomplete)
──────────────────────────

  • Solaris has this.


5.6 Dump to swap on zvol (incomplete)
─────────────────────────────────────

  • Solaris has this.


6 Conclusion (incomplete)
═════════════════════════

  Though it may seem like core dumps are a solved problem from the past,
  it turns out the core dump code is an ever changing routine that is
  constantly being adapted to the times.


6.1 Recommendations (incomplete)
────────────────────────────────

  • textdumps by defaults, but with better defaults?
  • documentation should include reccomendations on swap size for
    different amounts of ram
    • include amounts for fulldump, minidump and textdump at certain RAM
      sizes

8 Appendix
══════════

8.1 The Past: A Complete History of Core Dumps
──────────────────────────────────────────────

  The following sections list when different features of the core dump
  code were introduced starting with the core dump code itself. First
  the dump facility will be followed through the later versions of
  Research UNIX and then BSD through to present versions of FreeBSD.


8.2 Core Dumps in UNIX
──────────────────────

  Core dumping was initially a manual process. As documented in Version
  6 AT&T UNIX’s `crash(8)', an operator could take a core dump ``if
  [they felt] up to debugging’’. Though 6th Edition is not the first
  appearance of dump code in UNIX, it is the first complete repository
  of code the public has access to.


8.2.1 6th Edition UNIX
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  In 6th Edition UNIX `crash(8)' teaches us how to manually take a core
  dump:

        If the reason for the crash is not evident (see below for
        guidance on `evident’) you may want to try to dump the
        system if you feel up to debugging. At the moment a dump
        can be taken only on magtape. With a tape mounted and
        ready, stop the machine, load address 44, and start. This
        should write a copy of all of core on the tape with an EOF
        mark.

  6th Edition UNIX’s core dump procedure is defined in `m40.s' and
  `m45.s' give UNIX support for the PDP-11/40 and PDP-11/45.


8.2.2 7th Edition UNIX
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  7th Edition UNIX adds support for the PDP-11/70.


8.2.3 UNIX/32V
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  UNIX/32V was an early port of UNIX to the DEC VAX architecture making
  use of the C programming language to decouple the code from the
  PDP-11. `/usr/src/sys/sys/locore.s' contains the first appearance of
  `doadump()', the same function name used today, written in VAX
  assembly.


8.3 Core Dumps in BSD
─────────────────────

8.3.1 1BSD & 2BSD
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  1BSD and 2BSD inherited their dump code directly from 6th Edition UNIX
  and is therefore supports the PDP-11/40 and PDP-11/45.


8.3.2 3BSD
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  3BSD imports its’ dump code from UNIX/32V maintaining the name
  `doadump()'. Because of this pedigree, `doadump()' is written in VAX
  assembly.

  A ``todo’’ list found in `usr/src/sys/sys/TODO' notes that ``large
  core dumps are awful and even uninterruptible!’’.


8.3.3 4BSD
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  4BSD introduces a new feature to `doadump', printing tracing
  information with `dumptrc'.

  In addition, `usr/src/sys/sys/TODO' is the first mention of writing
  dumps to swap: “Support automatic dumps to paging area”.


8.3.4 4.1BSD
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  Beginning in 4.1BSD `doadump()' is relegated to setting up the machine
  for `dumpsys()' which is written in C and found in
  `sys/vax/vax/machdep.c'.

  As of 4.1c2BSD `doadump()' now fulfills the “todo” listed in 4BSD and
  dumps to the “paging area”, or swap. `savecore(8)' is introduced to
  extract the core from the swap partition and place it in the
  filesystem.

  • Support for VAX750, VAX780, VAX7ZZ (VAX730)
  • In 4.1c2BSD changes VAX7ZZ references to VAX730


8.3.5 4.2BSD

╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  • Added IA64, sparc64, and pc98 support.
  • New kernel dump infrastructure. Broken out to individual
    architectures again. `doadump()' is back!
  • Crash dumps can now be obtained in the late stages of kernel
    initialisation before single user mode


8.4.6 FreeBSD 6.0.0
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

8.4.6.1 FreeBSD 6.0.0
┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄

  • AMD64 and arm support added.
  • AMD64 and i386 switch to ELF as their crash dump format.
  • AMD64 and i386 bump their dump format to version 2.


8.4.6.2 FreeBSD 6.2.0
┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄

  • minidump code added.


8.4.7 FreeBSD 7.0.0
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

8.4.7.1 FreeBSD 7.0.0
┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄

  • sun4v support added
  • minidumps are now default
  • alpha support is removed


8.4.7.2 FreeBSD 7.1.0
┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄

  • textdump code is added


8.4.8 FreeBSD 8.0.0
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  • PowerPC support added.
  • mips support added.


8.4.9 FreeBSD 9.0.0
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  • Merge common amd64/i386 dump code under `sys/x86' subtree.
  • Only dump at first panic in the event of a double panic
  • Add dump command for DDB
  • Minidump v2


8.4.10 FreeBSD 10.0.0
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  • On systems with SMP, CPUs other than the one processing the panic
    are stopped. This behavior is tunable with the sysctl
    `kern.stop_scheduler_on_panic’


8.4.11 FreeBSD 11.0.0
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌

  • RISC-V support added.
  • arm64 support added.
  • Factored out duplicated code from `dumpsys()' on each each
    architecture into `sys/kern/kern_dump.c'
  • A `show panic’ command was added to DDB
  • “4Kn” kernel dump support. Dumps are now written out in the native
    block size. `savecore(1)' updated accordingly.
  • “4Kn” minidump support for AMD64 only
  • `strlcpy(3)' is used to properly null-terminate strings in kernel
    dump header


8.4.12 FreeBSD 12-CURRENT
